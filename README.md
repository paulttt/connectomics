## CellAnalysis

This toolbox supports the evaluation and benchmarking of segmentation masks of neuronal cell bodies for 3D and 2D images. Most of the high level easy-to-use classes and functions are implemented in the ```CellAnalysis/eval.py file. You can evaluate different kinds of segmentations with that package.
